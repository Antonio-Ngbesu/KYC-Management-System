## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 🚨 For Critical Security Issues

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please:

1. **Email us directly**: security@kyc-system.com
2. **Use encrypted communication** if possible
3. **Include detailed information**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### 📋 What to Include

When reporting a security issue, please include:

- **System Information**: OS, Python version, dependency versions
- **Vulnerability Details**: Clear description of the issue
- **Reproduction Steps**: How to reproduce the vulnerability
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential security implications
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots (if applicable)

### ⏱️ Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolved
- **Resolution**: Varies by severity (see below)

### 🔒 Severity Levels

| Severity     | Description                                 | Response Time |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Critical** | Remote code execution, data breach          | 1-3 days      |
| **High**     | Authentication bypass, privilege escalation | 3-7 days      |
| **Medium**   | Information disclosure, CSRF                | 1-2 weeks     |
